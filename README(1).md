# Credit Card Fraud Detection Model

This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The goal is to help financial institutions and businesses identify potentially fraudulent activities and reduce losses due to fraud.

## Overview

Credit card fraud is a significant issue in the financial sector, causing billions of dollars in losses annually. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can analyze transaction patterns and flag suspicious activities with high accuracy.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Support for various algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Visualization of results and confusion matrices

## Dataset

**Note:** Due to the large size of the dataset, it is not included in this repository.  
To run the code, please download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) or other trusted sources and place it in the appropriate directory.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/machine-learnin/Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_Model.git
    cd Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_Model
    ```

2. Download the dataset and place it in the project root.

3. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the main script to train and evaluate the model:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- xgboost (if using XGBoost)

See `requirements.txt` for the complete list.

## Results

Model performance metrics and visualizations are saved in the `results` directory after running the script.
